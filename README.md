# PhD Electronic Laboratory Notebook

Klementine Burrell-Sander is a PhD student at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. She is in the [SCOPE](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group led by [Associate Professor Alice Motion](http://alicemotion.com/) and the [Rutledge](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/~rutledge/home.htm) group led by [Professor Peter Rutledge](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/peter-rutledge.html), and is currently working on the [Open Source TB](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/) project as well as the [Breaking Good](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject) project. This ELN was started in March 2022. 

To navigate this ELN, please start at the Wiki page. This contains a brief summary of the various lines of work being pursued and links to specific reactions.

The best way to find a relevant ELN entry is to start in the Wiki where you can identify the compound/s and which project it belongs to. Opening the project it belongs to in the Projects tab then gives you a list of all the issues that are relevant to that project. Here you can look for those with the identifier for the molecule of interest. Clicking on a given title will take you to the issue for the ELN entry. Each title is categories based on its status - to-do, in progress, complete.

Experiments conducted for Open Source Mycetoma are identified as follows:

First three characters are KRS (initials of the experimentalist)
Underscore
Three numbers which are the main identifier of the molecule
Underscore
Two numbers which describe the repeat/batch number
For example, KRS_029_03 describes the third repeat/attempt at the synthesis of molecule 029 conducted by Kymberley.

Experiments conducted for The Breaking Good Project are identified as follows:

Year of program
Underscore
Program the molecule is contributing to e.g. SSP (The University of Sydney's Special Studies program), BG (breaking good core program)
Underscore
One letter followed by a number - the main identifier of the molecule that is being synthesised
Underscore
Two numbers which describe the repeat/batch number
For example, 2020_BG_1J_002 describes the second attempt at the synthesis of molecule 1J for the core Breaking Good program ran in 2022.

Issues are labelled with labels that describe the aim using the following:

New reaction - the first attempt at a reaction
Repeat - a repeat of a reaction already attempted/completed (the number of the repeat is described in the identify, see above).
Reaction optimisation - an experiment which is aiming to optimise the previous attempt/s
Upscale - an experiment where the amount of material has been increased from the first attempt
and with labels that describe the status

Reaction in progress - an experiment that is currently running
Purification - an experiment that has finished and is awaiting purification
Characterisation - an experiment that is complete with product that has been purified and has been used for characterisation experiments
When experiments are complete the issue is "closed".

All raw and processed characterisation data is stored in the file Characterisation Data above and is filed based on the experiment identifier.
