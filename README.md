# PhD Electronic Laboratory Notebook

Klementine Burrell-Sander is a PhD student at the University of Sydney in Sydney, Australia. She is in the [SCOPE](https://github.com/alintheopen/SCOPE) research group led by [Associate Professor Alice Motion](http://alicemotion.com/) and the [Rutledge](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/~rutledge/home.htm) group led by [Professor Peter Rutledge](https://www.sydney.edu.au/science/about/our-people/academic-staff/peter-rutledge.html), and is currently working on the [Open Source TB](https://github.com/OpenSourceTB/) project as well as the [Breaking Good](https://github.com/TheBreakingGoodProject) project. This ELN was started in March 2022. 

To navigate this ELN, please start at the Wiki page. This contains a brief summary of the various lines of work being pursued and links to specific reactions.

The best way to find a relevant ELN entry is to start in the Wiki where you can identify the compound/s and which project it belongs to. Opening the project it belongs to in the Projects tab then gives you a list of all the issues that are relevant to that project. Here you can look for those with the identifier for the molecule of interest. Clicking on a given title will take you to the issue for the ELN entry. Each title is categories based on its status - to-do, in progress, complete.

## Experiment Identifiers

Experiments conducted for **Open Source Tuberculosis** are identified as follows:

_KBSX-Y_

where
- KBS is the initials of the experimentalist (Klementine Burrell-Sander)
- X is a number used to identify the molecule
- Y is a number that indicates how many times the reaction has been repeated

For example, **KBS19-3** indicates the **third** attempt at synthesising molecule **KBS19**


Experiments conducted for The Breaking Good Project are identified as follows:

Year of program
Underscore
Program the molecule is contributing to e.g. SSP (The University of Sydney's Special Studies program), BG (breaking good core program)
Underscore
One number followed by a letter - the main identifier of the molecule that is being synthesised
Underscore
A number which indicates the batch number/number of attempts

For example, **2022_BG_1J_002** describes the **second** attempt at the synthesis of molecule **1J** for the core Breaking Good program ran in **2022**.

## Navigating issues 

Issues are labelled with labels that describe the experiments. This includes categorisation based on components of the molecular, the nature of the experiment (such as whether it is a new method, scale up or repeat) and other details on status (such as whether a reaction has been left incomplete). The descriptions of these labels can be viewed on the [Labels](https://github.com/KlementineJBS/USYD_PhD_ELN/labels) tab, and all issues with a given label can be found by clicking on the circle icon (see image below).

On the main issues page, issues are sorted into _open_ and _closed_. _Open_ issues represent experiments that are planned or in progress, while _closed_ issues represent experiments that have been completed or abandoned. 

To find a specific issue, you can search for keywords using the search bar located at the top of the issues page.

Please be aware that the search bar is autofilled to search only for open issues. If you wish to search among closed issues as well, simply delete the text reading "is:open", as in the image below, or click on the "Closed" tab to search _only_ among closed issues.

## Common abbreviations 

A number of abbreviations are used in this ELN, including abbreviations of chemicals and solvents that are commonly used in synthetic chemistry (e.g. MeCN for acetonitrile). Some of the more personalised abbreviations are collated here.

| Abbreviation | Meaning |
|-|-|
| SM | Starting material |
| RM | Reaction mixture |
| cr | crude |
| F | fraction(s) |
| C | column |


## Navigating projects

Projects are set up largely for the use of the ELN owner and newcomers to the ELN are encouraged to use the wiki to find reactions. 


## Characterisation data 

Characterisation data for each experiment can be found on the relevant issue. A series of _master pages_ collate characterisation data for a given molecule, with the best examples of characterisation data collected on that molecule so far. These master pages can be found in the [Wiki](https://github.com/KlementineJBS/USYD_PhD_ELN/wiki) tab and are currently organised by synthetic target. The molecule identifier is included in the title pages for ease of understanding.
